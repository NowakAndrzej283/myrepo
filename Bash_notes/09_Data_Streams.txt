# Data Streams

Data streams allow us to control where normal output goes aswell as where errors are printed.

There are 3 types of data streams:

- Standard output (for example we type 'ls' and we see the result)(1 designates standard output)
  Standard output is an output that is printed to the screen that doesn't constituted an error

- Standard error (after typing a command shows us an error)(2 designates standard error)

- Standard input (we want the user to input something)(for doing that we use 'read')

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Useful command which redirects both types of data streams into one file:

find /etc -type f &> file.txt  #ampersand means that we want both data streams redirected


Useful command which redirects standard output and standard error into two different files:

find /etc -type f 1> find_results 2> find_errors #if we want to append a file we shoul use ">>" instead

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding '-y' to the command in script is useful when we want to confirm some choices. For example an update script.
