expr - the evaluate expression command in BASH

For example: expr 30 + 10   - it is going to be 40 in terminal  

expr 100 * 4  - in this example the command is not going to work (due to the '*>

We can easily overcome the problem above using the command:
expr 100 \* 4   - (400 at the output)

We are also able to add numbers and variables like:
mynum=100
expr $mynum + 50    -(150 at the output)
