# While Loops

While loop is doing something until the given condition is true.

#1 Example code

#! /bin/bash

myvar=1

while [ $myvar -le 10 ]
do
        echo $myvar
        myvar=$(( $myvar +1 ))
        sleep 0.5
done

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2 Example code

#! /bin/bash

myvar=1

while [ $myvar -ge 1 ] && [ $myvar -le 17 ]
do
        echo $myvar
        myvar=$(( $myvar +1 ))
        sleep 0.5
done

echo "End of the loop"
