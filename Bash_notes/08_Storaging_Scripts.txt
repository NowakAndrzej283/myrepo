# Where to storage scripts

FHS - Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (Linux standard)

sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin  - changing permission to root in the user and group

The file extensions in Linux are not required at all. The file extensions in Linux are more for the user, not for the system.
We don't have to write the full path to the file to execute the script if we have put the script in /usr/local/bin location.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we want to add new directory to the PATH variable we should type :
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reason why we are able to execute the script without typing the extension is beacause we put the script in PATH variable. 
The shell is going to look inside the PATH to find a script or binary to run.
