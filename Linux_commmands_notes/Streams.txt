# Streams 

ls - standard output

echo $? - special sign (?) that shows us if the previous command was succesful (exit code)

Everything that is not equal to zero is an error. 
Everything that is equal to zero is succsess.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

find / -name *.log  - we are finding by name every file that ends with log

% Don't run a command as a root to hide the errors!!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

find / -name *.log 2> /dev/null   - execute the find command, search by name, capture standard error (2) and redirect that to /dev/null (purgatory)

The errors still exist but they are not in our output.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Three types of streams

stdin 0 - standard input which has designation '0'

stdout 1 - standard output which has designation '1'

stderr 2 - standard error which has designation '2'
