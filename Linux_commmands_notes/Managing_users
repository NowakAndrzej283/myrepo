# Managing users

cat /etc/passwd -we see all the users in our system 

        UID  
user:x:1000:1000:user user ,,,:/home/user:/bin/bash


The 'x' above tells us that there is a place for a password of a user "user". It is not going  to be listed there.
Every number of a user should be above 1000. Everything what is under 1000 is a system user.

Every UID under 1000 would not appear in the log in screen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cat /etc/shadow - this command shows us the passwords if we have a permission to open it

sudo cat /etc/shadow - now we are able to see what is inside

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cat /etc/group - we see a list of groups that are in the system

groups - this command shows us the groups that we are in.

groups username - we see the groups that username is a member

sudo adduser username - only root can add an user so we use the sudo command


# Changing user's details

su - username - we are logging to user's account

logout -(ctrl+D) command that we use if we want to logout

sudo su - username  - we log into user's account without a password

# Changing a password 

passwd - command that we use to change the password 

sudo passwd username - changing the passwd directly without logging in

sudo su -     - we are switching to root sothat we can change the passwords quicker
