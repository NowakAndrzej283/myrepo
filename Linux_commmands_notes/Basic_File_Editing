# Basic file editing / Moving and Renaming files

touch - creats a file 
cat - shows us what the file contains
which - shows as the path where the wanted file is/ if the file actually exists / if the file is installed

cp file1.txt newfile.txt - copies the content in file1 to the newfile.txt
diff file1.txt file 2.txt - tells us whether or not the files are different
rm - removes a file
rm -r - removes a directory (be carefull of using that command)
mv - moves a file (for example to another directory)
mv *.txt - this command moves everything that is finished by txt

mv file1.txt .. - these dots represents one directory above 
mv ../file1.txt . - the dot represents the current directory / moves the file from behind to current directory
