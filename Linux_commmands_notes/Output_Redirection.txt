# Output Redirection

ls -l > file.txt - we are redirecting the command ls -l into a file

We have to be careful with that command because if we have an existing file we are going to replace everything in that file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ls -l >> file.txt - we are redirecting the command ls -l but now we are appending the file (we are adding it at the end of a file)

ls -l | grep file  - we get just the lines contains the word "file"

cat file.txt | grep -v file.txt  - we are going to see everything without file.txt

ls -l | wc -l - shows us the count of items that we have in local directory

ls -l /etc | wc -l -  -||- in folder /etc
