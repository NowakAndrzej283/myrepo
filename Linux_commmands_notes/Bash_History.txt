# Bash History

history - command that we use to see the history of commands

!123 - we execute the command number 123 in history

Sometimes we don't want the commands to be visible due to the sensitive informations that they can include.

#If we want the commands to be hidden we use space before the command

_sudo apt update - the command doesn't appear in history
